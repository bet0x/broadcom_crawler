# Configuring VCF Single Sign-On

You can set up VCF Single Sign-On (SSO) for VCF to streamline user access with centralized authentication. VCF Single Sign-On offers Enterprise Admin users the ability to utilize Single Sign-On and access VCF components such as vCenter, VCF Operations, VCF Automation, VCF Operations for logs, VCF Operations for networks, VCF Operations orchestrator, VCF Operations HCX, and NSX, with one set of credentials. VCF Single Sign-On provides a seamless login experience with a single authentication source configured via the VCF Operations console across all the VCF components except SDDC Manager and ESX.

## Importance and Benefits of VCF Single Sign-On

Configuring VCF Single Sign-On equips you with:

- Improved User Experience: Users can log in once and gain seamless access to the VCF components they have been granted access to.
- Enhanced Security: Reduce password fatigue and strengthen protection against unauthorized access.
- Centralized Management: Manage the identity provider configuration and user and group provisioning across VCF Instances at a central location in VCF Operations.
- Support for modern and directory based identity providers: Support for both modern protocols such as OIDC 2.0, SAML 2.0, and directory services such as OpenLDAP and Active Directory.
