# Deleting Cloud Proxies

You can delete a cloud proxy if there are issues with your cloud proxy. For example, you can delete the cloud proxy from the cloud proxy page in case of incorrect deployment of your cloud proxy, or if you need to deploy your cloud proxy in another cluster, or if you no longer require a cloud proxy. After you delete a cloud proxy, data collection stops.

1. Log in to VCF Operations.
2. From the left menu, click AdministrationCloud Proxy.
3. Click the vertical ellipsis in front of the cloud proxy you want to delete and then click Delete.

   The confirmation wizard appears.
4. Select the I understand the risk check box and then click OK.
5. The cloud proxy is deleted.
