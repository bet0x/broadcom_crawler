# Start the ESX Hosts and vCenter in the Management Domain

You start the ESX hosts using an out-of-band management interface, such as, ILO or iDRAC to connect to the hosts and power them on.

You perform this operation on all clusters in management domain. The primary cluster where the management vCenter must be running must be started first.
