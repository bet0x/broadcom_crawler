# Managing your Environment Configurations

You can use VCF Operations Configuration Drifts feature to monitor and view the configuration settings of vCenter instances and vSphere clusters that have drifted from the desired configurations, without the need to manually track each change.

Configuration Drifts shows the changes in product configurations at a point in time and allows you to compare the changes to the assigned desired values. It provides a proactive method to monitor configuration changes.

This feature applies only to vCenter instances and vSphere clusters deployed in VCF 9.0 or later.

## Why use Configuration Drifts

Configuration Drifts offers several benefits, including:

1. Consistency: Ensures that vCenter instances and vSphere clusters are configured consistently. This helps reduce potential issues from configuration drift.
2. Compliance: Helps ensure that vCenter instances and vSphere clusters are configured to meet organizational policies and regulations.
3. Scalability: Allows for infrastructure configuration at scale.
