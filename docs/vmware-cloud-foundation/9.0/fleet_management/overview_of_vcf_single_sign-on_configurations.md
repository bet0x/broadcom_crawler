# Overview of VCF Single Sign-On Configurations

Use the SSO Overview page for a holistic overview of the VCF fleet that has been configured with VCF Single Sign-On.

From the SSO Overview page you can view VCF Identity Brokers that are grouped together. Click each VCF Identity Broker in the grid to view a list of VCF Instances that are connected to it. You can view information of each component that you click in the SSO Information pane on the right side.

In VCF Operations, you can monitor the status of VCF Identity Brokers based on parameters such as health and readiness. Health indicates if the VCF Identity Broker is up and running or not. Readiness indicates if the VCF Identity Broker is ready to accept incoming requests or not. From the VCF Operations console, navigate to InventoryIntegrations iconInfrastructure ManagementIdentity Broker health.
