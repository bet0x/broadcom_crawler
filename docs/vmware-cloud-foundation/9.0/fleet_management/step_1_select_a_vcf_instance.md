# Step 1: Select a VCF Instance

Choose the VCF Instance for which you want to configure VCF Single Sign-On.

**Prerequisite**

- Deploy and configure a VCF Instance with a management domain. For more information, see [Start a New VCF Fleet or a New VCF Instance Deployment by Using the VCF Installer Deployment Wizard](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/deploying-a-new-vmware-cloud-foundation-or-vmware-vsphere-foundation-private-cloud-/deploy-a-new-vcf-fleet-or-a-new-vcf-instance.html#GUID-1616bc34-5c5d-4923-92c3-824fced12538-en_id-6d0bb01e-6873-4242-9b86-8f8e190a8e25).

**Procedure**

1. From the VCF Operations navigation pane, select Fleet ManagementIdentity & Access.
2. (First time only) Review and acknowledge all of the prerequisite check boxes and click Continue.
3. From the Identity & Access navigation pane, click SSO Overview.
4. From the SSO Overview page, click the Select a VCF Instance drop down and select the VCF Instance where you would like to configure the identity provider to enable VCF Single Sign-On.

   If the identity source configuration for the specific VCF Instance is managed by another VCF Operations console, and you wish to manage the identity source configuration of the VCF Instance within the same VCF Operations console, see [Change the Identity Management of a VCF Instance Managed by Another VCF Instance](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/fleet-management/what-is/managing-vmware-cloud-foundation-operations-sso/change-the-identity-management-of-a-vcf-instance-managed-by-anotehr-instance-of-vcf-operations.html#GUID-6a29860f-de4e-457c-bbe9-935af86815cc-en_id-d5fa8348-0637-4ac4-ecb2-aa2697d91eb6).
