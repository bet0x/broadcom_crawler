# Plan a Workload Domain Upgrade

Before proceeding with a workload domain upgrade you must first plan the upgrade to your target version in the SDDC Manager UI.

Upgrade the management domain to VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0. See [Upgrade the Management Domain Core Components to VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2.html).

1. In the navigation pane, click InventoryWorkload Domains.
2. On the Workload Domains page, click the workload domain you want to upgrade and click the Updates tab.
3. Under Available Updates, click PLAN UPGRADE.
4. On the Plan Upgrade for VMware Cloud Foundation screen, select the target version from the drop-down, and click NEXT.

Bundles applicable to the chosen release will be made available to the workload domain.
