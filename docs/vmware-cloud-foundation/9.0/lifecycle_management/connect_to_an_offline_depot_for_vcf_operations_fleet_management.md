# Connect to an Offline Depot for VCF Operations fleet management

Offline depots simplify artifact distribution for air-gapped or dark-site users, reducing the steps needed to manage multiple VCF Instances.

To set up an offline depot either with a web server or a local server, a dedicated virtual machine must be available along with the details of your Bundle Transfer Utility server. For information about the requirements and process for creating an offline depot, see [Set Up an Offline Depot Web Server for VMware Cloud Foundation](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/deploying-a-new-vmware-cloud-foundation-or-vmware-vsphere-foundation-private-cloud-/preparing-your-environment/downloading-binaries-to-the-vcf-installer-appliance/connect-to-an-offline-depot-to-download-binaries/set-up-an-offline-depot-web-server-for-vmware-cloud-foundation.html).
