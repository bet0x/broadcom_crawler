# Generating a Download Token

Both the online depot and the offline depot that is a self-managed web server require a token that ensures the entitlement required to download binaries.

Before configuring the depot, you must generate a token that ensures the entitlement required to download binaries.

1. Log in to the [Broadcom Support Portal](https://support.broadcom.com/) and select VMware Cloud Foundation.
2. On My Dashboard, in the Quick Links box that appears, select Generate Download Token.
3. Find your Site ID on the list displayed and add it as input. Then click Generate Token.
4. Copy the token to use in VCF Operations fleet management appliance.
