# Lifecycle Management of VCF Core Components

Use VCF Operations to manage upgrade, patch, and install binaries for SDDC Manager, vCenter, NSX Manager, and ESX.

Before you can use the binaries for lifecycle management, you must download them to SDDC Manager. The method you use to download binaries depends on how you access the internet in your environment.

- Online depot: The SDDC Manager appliance can connect to the internet, either directly or through a proxy.
- Offline depot: The SDDC Manager appliance cannot connect to the internet, but can connect to a computer with internet access.
- No depot: The SDDC Manager appliance cannot connect to the internet or to a computer with internet access.

You can also use VCF Operations to manage ESX components and vSphere Lifecycle Manager images.
