# Downloading VCF Management Components into Binary Management

Binary management provides a centralized interface that administrators use to download component binaries for upgrades, patches, and installations.

Before downloading a binary for consumption, you must setup your depot configuration. See [Configuring depots in VCF management](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/lifecycle-management/using-the-depot-configuration-tab.html).

To download a binary, select Fleet ManagementLifecycleBinary Management and select the binary type, the VCF version, and the component for the request. Before clicking **DOWNLOAD**, ensure that you have selected the correct upgrade, patch, or install binary type. In that way, the correct button will appear when you are ready to upgrade, manage, or add your component.

To remove a binary, check the downloaded component and click the trashcan icon.
