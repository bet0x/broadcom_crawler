# vSAN Network Port Requirements

vSAN deployments require specific network ports and settings to provide access and services.

vSAN sends messages on certain ports on each host in the cluster. Verify that the host firewalls allow traffic on these ports. For the list of all supported vSAN ports and protocols, see the Broadcom Ports and Protocols Portal at <https://ports.broadcom.com/>.
