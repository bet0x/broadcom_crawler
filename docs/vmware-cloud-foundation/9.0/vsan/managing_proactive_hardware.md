# Managing Proactive Hardware

vSAN Proactive Hardware Management (PHM) informs you of any dying device based on disk predictive failure events generated by the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) vendor.

Ensure that you configured a supported Hardware Support Manager (HSM) and registered to vCenter to prevent predicative failures using PHM.

Based on this information provided by the vendor, you can take the necessary remediation. PHM resides within the vSAN management service on the vCenter. The HSM is registered with the vCenter. PHM collects vendor hardware information from HSM and sends it to vSAN.
