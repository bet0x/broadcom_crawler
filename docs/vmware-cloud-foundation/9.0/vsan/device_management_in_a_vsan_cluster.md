# Device Management in a vSAN Cluster

You can perform various device management tasks in a vSAN cluster.

You can create hybrid or all-flash disk groups, enable vSAN to claim devices for capacity and cache, turn LED indicators on or off, mark devices as flash, mark remote devices as local, and so on.

Marking devices as flash and marking remote devices as local are not supported in a vSAN ESA cluster.
