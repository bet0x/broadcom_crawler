# Using VMware NSX with vSAN

vSAN and VMware NSX can be deployed and coexist in the same vSphere infrastructure. A distributed vSwitch can support NSX and vSphere or vSAN traffic

NSX does not support the configuration of the vSAN data network over an NSX-managed VXLAN or Geneve overlay.

vSAN and NSX are compatible. vSAN and NSX are not dependent on each other to deliver their functionalities, resources, and services.
