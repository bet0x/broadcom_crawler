# Examining Performance in vSAN Cluster

Monitor the performance of virtual machines, ESX hosts, and the vSAN datastore to identify potential storage problems.

Monitor regularly the following performance indicators to identify faults in vSAN storage, for example, by using the performance charts in the vSphere Client:

- Datastore. Rate of I/O operations on the aggregated datastore.
- Virtual Machine. I/O operations, memory and CPU usage, network throughput and bandwidth.

You can use the vSAN performance service to access detailed performance charts. For information about using the performance service, see [Monitoring vSAN Performance](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/vsan-deployment-administration-and-monitoring/vsan-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/monitor-virtual-san-performance.html#GUID-6940e580-93c9-4f59-a8d7-ddf114067199-en).
