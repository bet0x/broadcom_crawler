# Creating a vSAN Stretched Cluster or Two-Node vSAN Cluster

You can create a vSAN stretched cluster that spans two availability zones. vSAN stretched clusters enable you to extend the vSAN datastore across two availability zones to use it as stretched storage. The vSAN stretched cluster continues to function if a failure or scheduled maintenance occurs at one zone.
