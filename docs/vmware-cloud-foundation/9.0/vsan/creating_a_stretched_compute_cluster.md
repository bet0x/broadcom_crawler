# Creating a Stretched Compute Cluster

You can create a stretched compute cluster where compute resources are stretched across two geographic locations (or sites).

Stretched compute clusters enable you to extend the compute resources, hosts, and workloads running on different sites to work as a single cluster. The stretched compute cluster continues to function if a failure or scheduled maintenance occurs at a site.
