# About Hardware Support Managers

The deployment method and the management of a hardware support manager are determined by the respective OEM vendor.

Several of the major OEM vendors develop and supply hardware support managers. For example:

- Dell - The hardware support manager that Dell provides is part of their host management solution, OpenManage Integration for VMware vCenter (OMIVV), which you deploy as an appliance.
- HPE - The hardware support managers that HPE provides are part of their management tools, iLO Amplifier and OneView, which you deploy as appliances.
- Lenovo - The hardware support manager that Lenovo provides is part of their server management solution, Lenovo XClarity Integrator for VMware vCenter, which you deploy as an appliance.

You can find the full list of all VMware-certified hardware support managers in the Broadcom Compatibility Guide under Platform & Compute section at <https://compatibilityguide.broadcom.com/>.
