# Verify the vSAN Cluster Upgrade

The vSAN cluster upgrade is not complete until you have verified that you are using the latest version of vSphere and vSAN is available for use.

1. Navigate to the vSAN cluster.
2. Click the Configure tab, and verify that vSAN is listed.
   - You also can navigate to your ESX host and select Summary > Configuration, and verify that you are using the latest version of the ESX host.
