# About the vSAN Performance Service

You can use vSAN performance service to monitor the performance of your vSAN environment, and investigate potential problems.

The performance service collects and analyzes performance statistics and displays the data in a graphical format. You can use the performance charts to manage your workload and determine the root cause of problems.

When the vSAN performance service is turned on, the cluster summary displays an overview of vSAN performance statistics, including IOPS, throughput, and latency. You can view detailed performance statistics for the cluster, and for each host, disk group, and disk in the vSAN cluster. You also can view performance charts for virtual machines and virtual disks.
