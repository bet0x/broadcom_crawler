# Monitor Physical Devices in vSAN Cluster

You can monitor ESX hosts, cache devices, and capacity devices used in the vSAN cluster.

1. In the vSphere Client, navigate to the cluster.
2. Click the Configure tab.
3. Under vSAN, click Disk Management to review all ESX hosts, cache devices, and capacity devices in the cluster. The physical location is based on the hardware location of cache and capacity devices on ESX hosts.

   The cache and capacity devices are available only in the vSAN OSA cluster.
