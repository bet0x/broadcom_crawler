# Designing and Sizing a vSAN Cluster

For best performance and use, plan the capabilities and configuration of your hosts and their storage devices before you deploy vSAN in a vSphere environment. Carefully consider certain host and networking configurations within the vSAN cluster.

The [Administering VMware vSAN](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/vsan-deployment-administration-and-monitoring/administering-vmware-vsan.html) documentation examines the key points about designing and sizing a vSAN cluster. For detailed instructions about designing and sizing a vSAN cluster, see [VMware vSAN Design Guide](https://www.vmware.com/docs/vmware-vsan-design-guide).
