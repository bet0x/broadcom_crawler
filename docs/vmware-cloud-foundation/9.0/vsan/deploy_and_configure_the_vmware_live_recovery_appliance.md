# Deploy and Configure the VMware Live Recovery Appliance

To enable vSAN replication, you must deploy the VMware Live Recovery appliance in the vSphere Client.

After deploying, you must configure the VMware Live Recovery appliance to connect to a vCenter instance on both the protected and the recovery sites.
