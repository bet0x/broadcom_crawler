# Disable a Stretched Compute Cluster

Depending on your requirement, you can disable a stretched compute cluster.

If you disable a stretched compute cluster, you convert the cluster to a compute cluster.

1. In the vSphere Client, navigate to the cluster.
2. Click the Configure tab.
3. Under vSAN, select Fault Domains.
4. Click Disable Stretched Compute Cluster to open the Disable stretched compute cluster dialog.
5. Click Disable.

   When you disable a stretched compute cluster, the existing fault domains configuration on the cluster gets removed.
