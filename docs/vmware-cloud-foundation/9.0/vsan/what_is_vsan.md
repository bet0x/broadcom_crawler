# What is vSAN

VMware vSAN is a software-defined, enterprise storage solution that supports hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) systems.

vSAN aggregates local or direct-attached capacity devices of all ESX hosts in a cluster and creates a single storage pool shared across all ESX hosts in the vSAN cluster. While supporting vSphere features that require shared storage, such as High Availability (HA), vMotion, and Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS), vSAN eliminates the need for external shared storage and simplifies storage configuration and VM provisioning activities.
