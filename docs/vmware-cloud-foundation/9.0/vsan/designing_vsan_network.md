# Designing vSAN Network

The Designing vSAN Network guide describes network requirements, network design, and configuration practices for deploying a highly available and scalable VMware® vSAN™ cluster.

vSAN is a distributed storage solution. As with any distributed solution, the network is an important component of the design. For best results, you must adhere to the guidance provided in this document as improper networking hardware and designs can lead to unfavorable results.

At VMware, we value inclusion. To foster this principle within our customer, partner, and internal community, we create content using inclusive language.

## Intended Audience

This guide is intended for anyone who is designing, deploying, and managing a vSAN cluster. The information in this guide is written for experienced network administrators who are familiar with network design and configuration, virtual machine management, and virtual data center operations. This guide also assumes familiarity with VMware vSphere, including VMware ESX, vCenter, and the vSphere Client.
