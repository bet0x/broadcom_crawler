# Replacing Existing Hardware Components in vSAN Cluster

Under certain conditions, you must replace hardware components, drivers, firmware, and storage I/O controllers in the vSAN cluster.

In vSAN, you should replace hardware devices when you encounter failures or if you must upgrade your cluster.

vSAN ESA contains a single storage pool of flash devices. Each flash device provides caching and capacity to the cluster.
