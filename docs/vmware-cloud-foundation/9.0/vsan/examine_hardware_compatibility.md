# Verify Drivers, Firmware, Storage I/O Controllers Against the VMware Compatibility Guide

Use the vSAN Skyline Health to verify whether your hardware components, drivers, and firmware are compatible with vSAN.

Using hardware components, drivers, and firmware that are not compatible with vSAN might cause problems in the operation of the vSAN cluster and the virtual machines running on it.

The hardware compatibility health findings verify your hardware against the Broadcom Compatibility Guide at <https://compatibilityguide.broadcom.com/>. For more information about using the vSAN Skyline Health, see [Monitoring vSAN Skyline Health](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/vsan-deployment-administration-and-monitoring/vsan-monitoring-and-troubleshooting/monitoring-vsan-skyline-health.html#GUID-889d7628-d46a-453a-87eb-727aae8155e8-en).
