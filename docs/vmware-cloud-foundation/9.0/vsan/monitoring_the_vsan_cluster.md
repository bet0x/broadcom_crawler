# Monitoring the vSAN Cluster

You can monitor the vSAN cluster and all the objects related to it.

You can monitor all of the objects in a vSAN environment, including ESX hosts that participate in a vSAN cluster and the vSAN datastore. For more information about monitoring objects and storage resources in a vSAN cluster, see the [vSphere Monitoring and Performance](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere/9-0/vsphere-monitoring-and-performance.html) guide.
