# License Requirements

Starting with version 9, product components are licensed automatically after you license the vCenter instance connected to the component. You no longer license vSAN manually. For more information, see the [VCF Licensing](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/bin/gethidpage?ux-context-string=vcom_839&appid=vcf-9-0&language=&format=rendered) guide.
