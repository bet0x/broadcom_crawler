# Shutting Down and Restarting the vSAN Cluster

You can shut down the entire vSAN cluster to perform
maintenance or troubleshooting.

Use the Shutdown Cluster wizard to shutdown the
vSAN cluster. The wizard performs the
necessary steps and alerts you when it requires user action. You also can manually shut
down the cluster, if necessary.

When you shut down a vSAN stretched cluster, the witness host remains
active.
