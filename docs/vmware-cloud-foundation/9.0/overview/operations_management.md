# Operations Management

VCF Operations provides capabilities designed to monitor, diagnose, and manage the health and security of your VCF environments, providing real-time insights and long-term strategic guidance.

## Health and Diagnostics

Discover and remediate known issues, and monitor the operational state of the private cloud infrastructure in VCF Operations.

| Health and Diagnostics Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| VCF Health | Continuously monitors the operational state of the VCF components in your environment to ensure they are functioning as expected. By proactively identifying potential issues such as expired certificates, NTP drifts, DNS misconfigurations, and configuration errors, you can take preventative actions before these issues escalate into significant problems. By using proactive monitoring, you can maintain a stable, secure, and efficient environment, reducing the risk of downtime and operational disruptions. VCF Health supports the following components and capabilities:   - VCF components    - vCenter   - ESX   - NSX   - vSAN - VCF capabilities    - vSphere vMotion   - Snapshots   - Workload operations - Common issues    - NTP Drifts   - DNS lookup issues   - Certificate expiry   For more details on VCF Health, see the following resources:   - [Monitor Your Environment and Prevent Issues with VCF Health](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/using-vcf-operations-diagnostics/monitor-your-environment-and-prevent-issues-with-vcf-health.html) documentation. Explains how to use VCF Health. - [Troubleshooting and Support - VCF Health](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-operate-vcf-health-journey.pdf) journey map. Represents a visual guide to the sequence of operations in VCF Health. |
| Diagnostics | Automatically detects known issues and critical vulnerabilities within the VCF software stack, providing detailed descriptions, root cause insights, and actionable remediation steps to resolve problems and mitigate risks.   - Diagnostic Findings  The Diagnostic Findings feature offers a consolidated view of known product issues, VMSA-based security exposures, and best-practice recommendations across your VCF environment. Diagnostic Findings helps VCF administrators gain visibility into potential issues and risks, prioritize resolution efforts, and achieve uninterrupted operations.  For more information how to use Diagnostics Findings, see the [What are Diagnostic Findings](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/using-vcf-operations-diagnostics/how-to-use-vcf-diagnostics-to-monitor-and-correct-your-environment/what-are-diagnostic-findings.html) documentation.  For a visual guide to the sequence of operations in Diagnostic Findings, see the [Operations - Diagnostic Findings](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-operate-diagnostic-findings-journey.pdf) journey map. - Log Assist  Log Assist streamlines the process of manually gathering and uploading support bundles used by VMware Technical Support Engineers (TSEs) to help solve customer technical issues. With the Log Assist feature, you can transfer support bundles to Broadcom Support from VCF Operations for the purpose of troubleshooting an open Support Case.  For more information about how to use Log Assist, see the [Use Log Assist to Accelerate Your Support Cases](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/using-vcf-operations-diagnostics/use-log-assist-to-accelerate-your-support-cases.html) documentation.  For a visual guide to the sequence of operations in Log Assist, see the [Troubleshooting and Support - Log Assist](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-support-log-assist-journey.pdf) journey map. |

## Integrated Operations

Integrated operations provide a complete network view with real-time health monitoring, traffic analysis, and application insights. They also simplify storage management by consolidating key insights into a unified view, enabling proactive optimization, efficient resource allocation, and minimized downtime. Data and Site Resiliency Monitoring provides centralized visibility into data protection metrics across private clouds. Log Operations introduces a standardized log format enabling different parts of the infrastructure to be troubleshooted together across different components.

| Integrated Operations Features | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Analyze Logs | Facilitates deep dive into infrastructure logs, with powerful query and filtering options to troubleshoot issues across your virtualized environment. You can analyse and visualize log data, and create custom queries for ongoing monitoring.  VCF Operations 9.0 introduces Operations for logs, a new native logging solution enabling you to configure log-based alerts, create dashboards, and explore logs directly within VCF Operations. Alerts, dashboards, and saved queries can be added to management packs. For other log configuration, or legacy log functionality, continue using the VCF Operations for logs UI.  Operations for logs supports VMware Aria Operations for Logs content packs. Transition to using log-based alerts, dashboards, and saved queries using VCF Operations management packs.  For more details on log analysis, see the following resources:   - [Configuring and Analyzing Logs](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/log-analysis.html) documentation. Explains how to perform log analysis. - [Operations - Logs](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-operate-logs-journey.pdf) journey map. Represents a visual guide to the sequence of log analysis operations. |
| Network Operations | View and manage the operational state of your VCF networking, allowing for streamlined troubleshooting and ensuring network performance is optimized.  Key capabilities include:   - Overview and summary of vSphere networking and NSX inventory. - Visibility into network alerts and their trends. - Monitoring of NSX health.\* - Monitoring of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs).\* - Discover applications based on network flows.\* - Traffic summary across the VCF environment for the past 24 hours.\*   \*Requires VCF Operations for networks to be deployed and attached.  For more details on network operations, see the following resources:   - [Network Operations](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/network-operationss.html) documentation. Explains how to monitor network operations. - [Operations - Network Operations](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-operate-networks-journey.pdf) journey map. Represents a visual guide to the sequence of network operations. |
| Storage Operations | View and manage centrally the operational state of your VCF storage, reviewing storage capacity and performance. Storage Operations provides the following capabilities:   - Centralized view of storage inventory, capacity utilization, and key performance statistics. - Visibility into the health of vSAN clusters, and drill down experience for further analysis. - Visibility into vSAN deduplication and compression for both vSAN ESA and OSA deployments, including the following objects:    - Space efficiency metrics   - New deduplication dashboards   - Health alerts - vSAN Performance Diagnostics, providing the following capabilities:    - Improves the performance of your vSAN cluster by running vSAN performance benchmark tests for a desired performance outcome.      - Maximize Throughput     - Maximize IOPs     - Minimize Latency   - Troubleshoots performance issues and provides guided remediation of the issues. The diagnostic tests can be run on both vSAN OSA and ESA HCI architectures.
