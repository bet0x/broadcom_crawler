# VCF Automation Overview

VMware Cloud Foundation Automation® (formerly VMware Aria Automation) or VCF Automation enables IT teams and cloud service providers (CSPs) to deliver a self-service private cloud for for AI, Kubernetes, and VM-based applications. The solution simplifies the process of provisioning and scaling a multi-tenant private cloud with out-of-the-box Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings, accelerating the time to market for applications while maintaining control using policy-based governance.

VCF Automation has the following capabilities:

- [Cloud Services](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9/what-is-vmware-cloud-foundation-and-vmware-vsphere-foundation/vcf-automation-overview/vcf-automation-cloud-services.html). Provides a set of cloud services to meet the needs of application teams.
- [Provider Management](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9/what-is-vmware-cloud-foundation-and-vmware-vsphere-foundation/vcf-automation-overview/provider-management.html). Supports IT teams and cloud service providers to effectively manage, deliver, and scale cloud services across multiple vCenter and VCF instances.
- [Organization Management](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9/what-is-vmware-cloud-foundation-and-vmware-vsphere-foundation/vcf-automation-overview/organization-management.html). Provides capabilities that enable the organization administrator of a Line of Business or a tenant to further organize and govern resources allocated to them among application teams.
- [vSphere Supervisor](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9/what-is-vmware-cloud-foundation-and-vmware-vsphere-foundation/vcf-automation-overview/vsphere-supervisor.html). Provides the capability to run Kubernetes workloads directly on ESX hosts and to create upstream Kubernetes clusters within dedicated namespaces.
