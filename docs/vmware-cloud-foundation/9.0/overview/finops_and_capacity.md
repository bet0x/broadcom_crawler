# FinOps and Capacity

Cost management helps you analyze your infrastructure expenses. In this way, you can identify areas that are most suitable to use capacity management for optimal utilization of your resources.

## FinOps

You can use the FinOps or cost management capabilities to monitor infrastructure-related costs and associated services or license expenses with greater precision. It also enables showback and chargeback capabilities, helping application teams understand and manage the cost of the infrastructure they consume.

To support this, VI administrators and provider administrators can use a range of features such as Cost Drivers for expense attribution, Pricing Policies for rate card definitions, Showback for distributing costs based on actual usage, and Chargeback for billing tenants or application teams using predefined pricing models.

Additionally, you can use the Cost Overview and Analysis capabilities to visualize, deep-dive and make sense of your infrastructure expenses across the environments.

For more information, see the [Configuring Cost](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/cost-and-capacity-management/business-management.html) documentation.

## Capacity Management

Capacity Management consists of 3 sets of capabilities - assess, optimize and plan.

Use capacity planning to evaluate the capacity requirements of your organization based on historical resource utilization and real-time predictive projections to plan ahead.

Capacity assessment lets you evaluate the available and consumed capacity (compute and storage).

Capacity optimization helps you right-size or reclaim any underutilized or wasted resources.

- Workload Placement lets you optimize virtual machines and storage across clusters to reduce resource contention and maintain optimum system performance.
- By using What-If Analysis, you can plan for an increase or decrease in workload or capacity requirements in your virtual infrastructure. To evaluate the demand and supply for capacity on your resources, and to assess the potential risk to your current capacity, you can run scenarios for adding and removing workloads. You can also determine how much capacity you require to make a migration work. You can run one scenario or group scenarios and run them cumulatively.

## Green Score

The VMware Green Score is used to measure sustainability in digital operations through data center virtualization. Gren Score consists of multiple parameters for effective measurement of the score. Virtualization plays a crucial role in optimizing resource utilization, helping reduce hardware footprints in the data centers and further enabling savings in power consumption and floor space. This improves the overall efficiency and curbs carbon emissions resulting from IT infrastructure and operations.
