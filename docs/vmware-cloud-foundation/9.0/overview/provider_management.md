# Provider Management

IT teams and CSPs can model multi-tenancy by using the concept of Organizations in VCF Automation, effectively allocating resources and managing users specific to each Organization.

This capability provides isolated environments with dedicated network setup. IT Teams and CSPs can monitor resource usage, control permissions, and provide managed services while ensuring security through comprehensive network isolation.
