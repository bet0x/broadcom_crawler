# Organization Management

VCF Automation improves governance for users and resources by enabling organization administrators create and assign projects and vSphere Namespaces tailored for different application teams.

Organization administrators can set resource limits and policies while delegating network management through Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) for application teams. Additionally, Policy as Code enables organization administrators to enforce instance-centric policies for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources from a central location for compliance and reducing the risk of human error.
