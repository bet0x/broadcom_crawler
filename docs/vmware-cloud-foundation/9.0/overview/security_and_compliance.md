# Security and Compliance

The security management area of VCF Operations includes capabilities such as Security Operations, Event Auditing, and Compliance Checks.

## Security Operations

The Security Operations dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of your security posture in VCF. This dashboard consolidates elements related to user and infrastructure security to help you identify areas that might require attention and tightening based on your security exposure. It complements the Compliance capability within VCF Operations by surfacing core aspects of VCF security in one place.

For more details on security operations, see the following resources:

- [Monitoring Security Operations](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/security-and-compliance/viewing-and-configuring-security-compliance.html) documentation. Explains how to use security operations.
- [Operations - Security Operations](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-operate-security-journey.pdf) journey map. Represents a visual guide to the sequence of security operations.

## Events Auditing

Event auditing provides visibility into platform interaction changes across the VCF infrastructure and insights into suspicious access events and policy violations. It increases user accountability as each action is registered in these events.

For more information, see the [Viewing and Configuring Audit Events](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/security-and-compliance/configuring-and-viewing-audit-events.html) documentation.

## Compliance

Ensure compliance for your VCF infrastructure and cloud environments against optimum configurations, maintaining a consistent configuration across SDDC components, reducing organizational and business risk.

For more information, see the [Measuring Compliance of Objects](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/security-and-compliance/viewing-and-configuring-compliance/measuring-compliance-of-objects.html) documentation.
