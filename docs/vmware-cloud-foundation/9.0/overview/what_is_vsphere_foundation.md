# What Is vSphere Foundation?

VMware vSphere Foundation (vSphere Foundation) is an enterprise-grade workload platform for modern infrastructure delivering virtualized benefits, simplified management, cost efficiency, scalability and serves as the core foundation for VCF.

vSphere Foundation provides the following capabilities:

- Unified workload platform for running VMs and containers side by side in a native Kubernetes runtime.
- Intelligent operations management for visibility and infrastructure optimization.
- Hyperconverged infrastructure integrating compute and storage virtualization for resource management.
- Simplified deployment and scalability enabling faster application delivery and future ready infrastructure.

vSphere Foundation does not include the cloud management and integrated automation capabilities that are available in VMware Cloud Foundation.
