# Cloud Services

VCF Automation provides a set of cloud services which are accessible on a self-service basis using multiple interfaces, including UI, CLI, and API.

With this interface, users can provision the following types of workloads:

- VMs
- Kubernetes workloads
- Networking
- Volumes
- Secret stores
- Databases
- Harbor container registries
- External DNS
- Certificates
- AI workloads

Additionally, application teams can also provision resources on a self-service basis from Catalogs which are backed by pre-configured workload templates. These self-service options help developers focus on application development instead of managing the underlying infrastructure.

For more information about cloud services, see the [Building Cloud Applications](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/building-your-cloud-applications.html) documentation.
