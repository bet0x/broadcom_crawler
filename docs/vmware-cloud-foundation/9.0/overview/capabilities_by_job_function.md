# Capabilities by Job Function

The VMware Cloud Foundation platform provides capabilities for all stages in the private cloud lifecycle and for all job functions working with the cloud’s resources.

## Job Functions Supported in a VMware Cloud Foundation Platform

The following functions are related to a VCF private cloud instance:
