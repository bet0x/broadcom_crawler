# Workload Operations

Workload operations ensure that critical applications are running properly by monitoring its performance, availability and end-user experience. For container-based applications, VCF Operations provides native integration with vSphere Supervisor which enables automatic monitoring of Supervisor instances and vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) clusters at a granular level, shortening troubleshooting time.

A business application consists of a set of interconnected applications or services running on one or more virtual machines which together offer a service to users. Business applications are enhanced to include application discovery based on Network Flows.
