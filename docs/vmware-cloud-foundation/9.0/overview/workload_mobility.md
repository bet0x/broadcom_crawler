# Workload Mobility

VCF Operations HCX is a workload mobility platform for migration and interconnection of workloads within and across VCF private clouds.

You can perform secure and automated migrations without requiring changes to applications or network configurations. Important features include multiple migration types, such as live and bulk migration, as well as network extension, which preserves existing IP addresses and network topologies. Thus, you can place workloads based on business requirements. The platform minimizes downtime during migrations, improves scalability, and supports compliance and security throughout workload transitions.

For more information, see the [Workload Mobility](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/workload-mobility.html) documentation.
