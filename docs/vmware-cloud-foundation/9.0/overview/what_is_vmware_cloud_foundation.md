# What Is VMware Cloud Foundation?

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) is a private cloud platform that delivers public cloud scale and agility with on-premises security, resilience and performance, while lowering total cost of ownership.

VMware Cloud Foundation ® can help you accelerate digital innovation with faster infrastructure modernization, a unified cloud experience, along with stronger cyber resilience and platform security.
