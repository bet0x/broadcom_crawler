# Planning and Preparation

As a VI administrator, size your environment and create a specification of the software, tools, and external services that are required to build a VCF private cloud.

## VCF Planning and Preparation Workbook

You can use the [VCF Planning and Preparation Workbook](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/content/dam/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/assets/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9.0-planning-and-preparation-workbook.xlsx) for sizing your environment, as a dynamic VCF environment specification, for updating requirements according your design, and more. The workbook is a Microsoft Excel workbook that helps you gather the inputs required for deploying a VCF fleet including workload domains, VCF Identity Broker, vSphere Supervisor, and VCF Automation.

## VCF Planning Tools

You can use the [VMware Configurations Maximums](https://configmax.broadcom.com/) and [VMware Ports and Protocols](https://ports.broadcom.com/) tools to plan the VCF setup that can run your end user workloads according to the requirements of your organization.
