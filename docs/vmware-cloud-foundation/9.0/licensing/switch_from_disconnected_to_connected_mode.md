# Switch from Disconnected to Connected Mode

You can switch from connected to disconnected, and from disconnected to connected mode at any time.

To switch from disconnected to connected mode, verify that your environment is connected to the Internet.

If your VCF Operations instance operates in disconnected mode for more than 180 days, switching from disconnected to connected connection might fail, and you must generate a new activation code. For information on how to generate a new activation code, see [Register VCF Operations in Connected Mode](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/licensing/register-vcf-operations/register-vcf-operation-in.html).

1. Log in to VCF Operations, and select License ManagementRegistration.
2. Click Switch to Connected.
3. In the Switch Reporting Mode dialog box, click Switch to Connected.

Your VCF Operations instance operates in connected mode. License usage is reported automatically. You must update your licenses on regular intervals. For more information about updating your licenses, see [Update Licenses in Connected Mode.](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/licensing/update-licenses/updatelicenses.html)
