# Switch from Connected to Disconnected Mode

You can switch from connected to disconnected, and from disconnected to connected mode at any time. In connected mode, usage reporting is automated, and the update of licenses is simplified.

1. Log in to VCF Operations, and select License ManagementRegistration.
2. Click Switch to Disconnected.
3. In the Switch Reporting Mode dialog box, click Switch to Disconnected.

Your VCF Operations instance operates in disconnected mode. You must manually report license usage, and then upload license files in VCF Operations. For more information about reporting license usage and updating your licenses, see [Report License Usage and Update Licenses in Disconnected Mode](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/licensing/update-licenses/update-licenses-in-disconnected-mode.html).
