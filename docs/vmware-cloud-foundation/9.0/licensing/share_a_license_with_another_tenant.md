# Share a License with Another Tenant

You can share licenses from your default tenants to any tenant that you have access to.

If you are a direct customer, verify that the license type is Split.

1. Log in to the VCF Business Services console (vcf.broadcom.com).
2. Under License Management, click Licenses.
3. Click the vertical ellipsis next to the license.
4. Select Share with Another Tenant.

   You receive the following message.

   License license-name has been successfully shared with tenant-name. You can view the shared licenses in the Shared with Others tab.

The license is now part of the Shared with Others tab. You can add the license to a VCF Operations instance in the tenant you share the license with. The tenant that you share the license with has access to the modifications of the license after sharing. In the License History tab, cloud services providers and hyperscalers can see the modifications of the license before and after sharing.
