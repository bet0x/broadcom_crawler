# Revoke License Sharing with Another Tenant

You can revoke the license sharing with another tenant.

You can only revoke sharing for licenses that are not added to a VCF Operations instance. After you revoke the license successfully, the type of the license changes from Shared to Split. You can share the license again or can manage the license in the tenant it was initially part of.

1. Log in to the VCF Business Services console (vcf.broadcom.com).
2. Under License Management, click Licenses.
3. Navigate to the Shared with Others tab.
4. Click Revoke Shared License.

   You receive a confirmation message. The license is no longer shared with another tenant.

The license is now part of the Version 9+ tab as a Split license.
