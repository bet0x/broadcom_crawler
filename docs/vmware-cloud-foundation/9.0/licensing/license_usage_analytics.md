# License Usage Analytics

License usage analytics are available both in the VCF Operations instance that you use for license management, and in the VCF Business Services console. You can access your license usage data at any time to check the aggregate license usage per product and per license.

With your subscription for a product, you also receive license keys for version 8.x of the product. You can decide which version of the product to deploy and license, but your total license usage must not exceed your purchased subscription capacity. You can use the usage analytics data to monitor license usage and change license capacity.

If at a certain point the used capacity is higher than the capacity allocated to the assigned licenses, you must allocate more capacity to the licenses. Before you add more capacity, you cannot assign the over used licenses to new vCenter instances. To the vCenter instances which are licensed with the over used licenses, you can only add new ESX hosts that are in evaluation mode.
