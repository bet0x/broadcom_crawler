# Deactivate License Sharing for Portability with a Provider in VCF Business Services Console

If end customers want to share the license with a different provider or keep the license for personal use, they can deactivate the license sharing for portability.

Verify that the license is not added to a VCF Operations instance.

You can only deactivate sharing for portability for licenses that are not added to a VCF Operations instance. After you deactivate the license sharing for portability successfully, the type of the license changes from Shared to Split. You can share the license again with a different provider or keep the license for personal use.

1. Log in to the VCF Business Services console (vcf.broadcom.com).
2. Under License Management, navigate to the Version 9+ tab.
3. Click the vertical ellipsis next to the license.
4. Select Manage Sharing for Portability.
5. Click the Deactivate Sharing for Portability toggle button.

   You receive a confirmation message. The license is no longer shared for portability with the provider.
