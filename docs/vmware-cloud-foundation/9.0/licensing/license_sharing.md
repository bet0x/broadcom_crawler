# License Sharing

License sharing has two forms - license sharing for portability and license sharing between tenants.

## License Sharing for Portability

End customers can activate sharing for portability on a license and share a license with a cloud services provider or hyperscaler who then validates the license. For more information, see [License Sharing for Portability](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/licensing/license-sharing/license-sharing(1).html).

## License Sharing with Another Tenant

End customers and cloud services providers can share a license between tenants that they have access to. For more information, see [Share a License with Another Tenant](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/licensing/license-sharing/license-sharing-between-tenants.html).
