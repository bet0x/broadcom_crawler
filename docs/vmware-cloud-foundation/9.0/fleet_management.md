# Fleet Management

Use **VCF Operations** as a VI administrator to manage identity and access, certificates, passwords, tags, configuration profiles, and availability of the VCF fleet.

For VCF, you use VCF Operations and in certain cases individual components for these capabilities. For vSphere Foundation, you perform the supported operations on the individual management components.

## Getting to Know VCF

To apply this documentation, you must be acquainted with the [VCF Product Overview](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9.html), [VCF Design](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/design.html), and [VCF Release Notes](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/release-notes.html).

## Deploying or Converging to VCF and Setting Up Cloud Infrastructure

For information about deploying or convering to a VCF fleet or VCF Instance, see [Deployment, Convergence, and Upgrade](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment.html). For information about adding infrastructure and configuring storage and networking for workloads in VCF Operations and the vSphere Client as a VI administrator, see [Building Cloud Infrastructure](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/building-your-private-cloud-infrastructure.html).

## Managing the Lifecycle of Your VCF Platform

You can manage software binaries and update your VCF fleet and VCF Instance centrally in VCF Operations. See [Lifecycle Management](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/lifecycle-management.html).

## SDKs, APIs, and CLI for VCF Administration

You can build, operate, and manage your VCF private cloud by using the VCF SDK and APIs, and VCF PowerCLI. See [Administration SDKs, APIs, and CLI](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/administration-sdks-cli-and-tools.html).
