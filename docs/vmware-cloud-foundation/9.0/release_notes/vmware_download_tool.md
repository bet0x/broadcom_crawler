# VMware Download Tool

Patch releases provide time-sensitive fixes to security and catastrophic issues, impacting business operations, that need to be released between major, minor, and maintenance releases. You can pick and choose which components to apply based on the impact on your environment and operational costs. Patch releases are not synchronized among all VCF components and do not require a new implementation of a Bill Of Materials.
