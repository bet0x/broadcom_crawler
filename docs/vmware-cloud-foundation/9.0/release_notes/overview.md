# Overview

VMware Cloud Foundation is a unified private-cloud platform that combines the scale and agility of public cloud with security and performance of private cloud, delivering increased productivity and lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Modernize infrastructure with integrated, enterprise-class compute, networking, storage, management, and security across all endpoints. With automated infrastructure and intelligent operations, organizations can optimize performance, lower costs and reduce operational overhead.  Accelerate innovation with a self-service IaaS platform that delivers a modern cloud interface to run VMs, containers and AI workloads. With built-in security and resiliency, safeguard the business, ensure business continuity, and free up teams to focus on innovation instead of addressing security threats.
