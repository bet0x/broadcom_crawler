# VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0.1.0 Release Notes

Maintenance releases provide bug and security fixes, hardware enablement changes, such as support for servers, CPUs, devices, driver updates, guest OS support, and backward-compatible new features. They are limited in scope to minimize the operational impact. You can pick and choose which components to apply based on the impact on your environment and operational costs. For example, if you run into a critical issue with vCenter, you do not need to apply a patch to ESX that is irrelevant to your environment. Maintenance releases are synchronized among VCF components with a new Bill Of Materials.
