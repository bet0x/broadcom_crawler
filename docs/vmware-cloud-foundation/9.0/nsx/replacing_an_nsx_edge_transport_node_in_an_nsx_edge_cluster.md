# Replacing an NSX Edge Transport Node in an NSX Edge Cluster

You can replace an NSX Edge transport node in an NSX Edge cluster using the NSX Manager UI or the API.

The ACL (Access Control List) rules configured on the NSX Edge node to be replaced will be lost. The rules will not be present on the new node.
