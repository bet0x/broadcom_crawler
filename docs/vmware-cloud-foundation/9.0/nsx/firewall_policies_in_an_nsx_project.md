# Firewall Policies in an NSX Project

When an NSX project is realized successfully, the system creates default gateway firewall and distributed firewall rules to govern the default behavior of the north-south traffic and east-west traffic for the workloads in the NSX project. For more details about firewall policies in an NSX project, see [VMware vDefend Firewall](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-security-load-balancing/vdefend/vdefend-firewall/9-0.html) documentation.
