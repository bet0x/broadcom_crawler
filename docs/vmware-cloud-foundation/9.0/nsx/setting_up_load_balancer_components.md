# Setting Up Load Balancer Components

To use logical
load balancers, you must start by configuring a load balancer and attaching it
to a tier-1 gateway.

Next, you set up health check monitoring for your
servers. You must then configure server pools for your load balancer. Finally, you must create
a layer 4 or layer 7 virtual server for your load balancer and attach the newly created
virtual server to the load balancer.
