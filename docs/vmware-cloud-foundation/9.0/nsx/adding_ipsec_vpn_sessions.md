# Adding IPSec VPN Sessions

After you have
configured an IPSec VPN service, you must add either a policy-based IPSec VPN
session or a route-based IPSec VPN session, depending on the type of IPSec VPN
you want to configure. You also provide the information for the local endpoint
and profiles to use to finish the IPSec VPN service configuration.
