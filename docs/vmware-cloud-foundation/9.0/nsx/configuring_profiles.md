# Configuring Profiles

Profiles allow you
to consistently configure identical capabilities for network adapters across
multiple hosts or nodes.

Profiles are containers for the
properties or capabilities that you want your network adapters to have. Instead
of configuring individual properties or capabilities for each network adapter,
you can specify the capabilities in the profiles, which you can then apply
across multiple hosts or nodes.
