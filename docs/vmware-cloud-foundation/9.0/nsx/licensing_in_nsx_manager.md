# Licensing in NSX Manager

Starting with VMware Cloud Foundation 9, product components are licensed automatically after you license the vCenter instance connected to the component. You no longer license NSX manually. For more information, see [Licensing Overview](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/bin/gethidpage?ux-context-string=vcom_839&appid=vcf-9-0&language=&format=rendered) in the *Licensing* guide.
