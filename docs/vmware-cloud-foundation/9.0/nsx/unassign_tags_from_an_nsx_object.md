# Unassign Tags from an NSX Object

You can remove tags that you had assigned previously to an object.

The following procedure explains the steps for unassigning or removing tags from a
single NSX object. For this procedure,
the segment object is considered. The steps for unassigning tags from other objects
remain the same. You can navigate to the specific feature page, and follow similar
steps to unassign tags from the object.

1. From your browser, log in to an
   NSX Manager at
   https://nsx-manager-ip-address.
2. Edit an object. 

   For example, click NetworkingSegments. Next to the segment that you want to edit, click ![Actions menu](/content/broadcom/techdocs/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/_jcr_content/assetversioncopies/7504cc2e-f1d9-49a4-8e3d-c53a8d1e944b.original.png), and then click Edit.
3. Click the
   X icon for each tag that you want to unassign from
   the segment.
4. Click Save.
