# IP Address Management (IPAM)

To manage IP
addresses, you can configure DNS (Domain Name System), DHCP (Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol), IP address pools, and IP address blocks.

IP blocks are used by
NSX Container Plugin (NCP). For more info about NCP, see the
NSX Container Plug-in
for Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry - Installation and Administration
Guide.
