# Storage of Public Certificates and Private Keys for Load Balancer or VPN service

Public certificates and private keys
are stored on the NSX Managers for load balancer
or VPN service. When a load balancer or VPN service is created that requires a private key,
NSX Manager sends a copy of the private key to the Edge node where the load balancer
or VPN service is running.
