# NSX Multi-tenancy

NSX supports multi-tenancy where you can configure multiple tenants on a
single NSX deployment. Multi-tenancy enables
you to isolate security and networking configurations across tenants.

NSX users across tenants can access the same NSX Manager to provision networking and
security objects on shared hosts.
