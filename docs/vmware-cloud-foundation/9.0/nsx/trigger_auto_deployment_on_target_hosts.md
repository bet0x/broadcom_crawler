# Trigger Auto Deployment on Target Hosts

When a new node is added to the cluster, it needs to be manually rebooted for the
ESX and NSX VIBs to be configured.

Only applies to stateless
hosts.

There are two ways to prepare hosts to
trigger auto-deployment of ESX and
NSX VIBs to be configured.

- Reboot hosts before applying
  TNP to the stateless cluster.
- Reboot hosts after applying TNP
  to the stateless cluster.

Reboot hosts before applying TNP to the
stateless cluster. See [Reboot Hosts Before Applying TNP](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/advanced-network-management/administration-guide/host-profile-integration-with-nsx/auto-deploy-stateless-cluster/trigger-auto-deployment-on-target-hosts/reboot-hosts-before-applying-tnp.html#GUID-d0232889-18b9-4f1e-957d-a9200a1024f0).
