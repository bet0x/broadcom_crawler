# Firewall Policies in an NSX VPC

When an NSX VPC is realized successfully, the system creates default north-south and east-west firewall rules to govern the default firewall behavior for the workloads in the NSX VPC. For more details about firewall policies in an NSX VPC, see [VMware vDefend Firewall](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-security-load-balancing/vdefend/vdefend-firewall/9-0.html) documentation.
