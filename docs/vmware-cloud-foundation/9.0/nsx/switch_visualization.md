# Switch Visualization

You get a granular view of a vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) at an individual host level.

1. From a browser, log in with admin privileges to an NSX Manager at https://<nsx-manager-ip-address> or https://<nsx-manager-fqdn>.
2. Select SystemFabricHosts.
3. Select Clusters or Standalone Hosts tab.
4. For any host, click View Details.
5. In the Host Details window, select the Overview tab and see visualization of VDS switch.

   The VDS switch visualization shows the uplinks and the NICs the switch is connected to.
