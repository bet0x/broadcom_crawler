# NSX Federation

With NSX Federation, you can manage multiple NSX environments with a single pane of glass view, create gateways and segments that span one or more locations, and configure and enforce firewall rules consistently across locations.

Once you have installed the Global Manager and have added locations, you can configure networking and security from Global Manager.

For information about the initial NSX Federation configuration, including installing Global Manager and adding locations, see [Getting Started with](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/advanced-network-management/administration-guide/managing-nsx-t-in-multiple-locations/nsx-t-federation/getting-started-with-federation.html).
