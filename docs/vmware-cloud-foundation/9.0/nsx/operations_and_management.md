# Operations and Management

You may need to
change the configuration of the appliances you've installed, for example,
adding licenses, certificates, and changing passwords. There are also routine
maintenance tasks that you should perform, including running backups.
Additionally, there are tools to help you find information about the appliances
that are part of the
NSX
infrastructure and the logical networks created by
NSX, including
remote system logging, traceflow, and port connections.
