# vDefend Firewall with Advanced Threat Prevention

VMware vDefend Firewall with Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) is a software-defined Layer 2–7 firewall purpose-built to secure virtualized workloads in a private cloud. It provides stateful firewalling with threat prevention capabilities that protect organizations against advanced threats. VMware vDefend Firewall is available in two form factors: a Distributed Firewall that can be deployed at each vSphere workload and a Gateway Firewall that can be deployed on a vSphere host, either as a Virtual Machine (VM) or as an ISO image on a physical server.

Advanced Threat Prevention (ATP) combines multiple detection technologies—Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS), Network Sandboxing, and Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)—with aggregation, correlation, and context engines from Network Detection and Response (NDR).
