# Monitoring NSX Host Transport Nodes

The
system collects statistics from each ESX
host transport node and exports them to NSX Manager. These statistics can help you monitor the overall health of the
host transport nodes.

The collection of health monitoring
statistics is activated by default for all the host transport nodes in the system.
