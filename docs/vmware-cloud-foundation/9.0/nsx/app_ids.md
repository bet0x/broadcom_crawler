# App IDs

Layer 7 attributes (App IDs) identify which application a particular packet or flow is generated by, independent of the port that is being used. Using App IDs reduces north south and east west attacks by only allowing appropriate traffic across an open port.

Enforcement based on App IDs enable users to allow or deny applications to run on any port, or to force applications to run on their standard port. vDPI enables matching packet payload against defined patterns, commonly referred to as signatures. Signature-based identification and enforcement enables customers to match the particular application/protocol a flow belongs to, and the version of that protocol, for example TLS version 1.2, TLS version 1.3, or different versions of CIFS traffic. This allows you to have visibility into or restrict the use of protocols that have known vulnerabilities for all deployed applications, and their E-W flows within the datacenter.

Layer 7 App IDs are used in context profiles and L7 access profiles in distributed firewall and gateway firewall rules.

NFS version 4 is not a supported
attribute.

- Gateway firewall rules do not support the
  use of FQDN attributes or other sub attributes in context profiles.
- Context profiles are not supported on
  tier-0 gateway firewall policy.

Supported App IDs and
FQDNs:

- For FQDN, users need to configure a high
  priority rule with a DNS App ID for the specified DNS servers on port 53.
- SYSLOG App ID is detected only on standard
  ports.

Below is a table with the list of both Basic and Advanced App IDs.
