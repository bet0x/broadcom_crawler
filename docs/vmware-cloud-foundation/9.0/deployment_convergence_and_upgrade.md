# Deployment, Convergence, and Upgrade

Get to VMware Cloud Foundation or VMware vSphere Foundation 9. Use **VCF Installer** and **VCF Operations** for automated deployment workflows and manually deploy the final components to complete your platform.

You can deploy a new VCF or vSphere Foundation platform on pre-installed ESX hosts by using VCF Installer.

You can also use your existing virtual infrastructure, in multiple scenarios, as building blocks and converge it to a VCF or vSphere Foundation platform. For converging you update your existing infrastructure to version 9 prior to deploying more components by using VCF Installer.

You can upgrade your existing VCF 5.x environment, with a starting state that includes or not management components, to VCF 9.
