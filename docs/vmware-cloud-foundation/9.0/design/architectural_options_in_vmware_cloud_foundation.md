# Architectural Options in VMware Cloud Foundation

To design a VMware Cloud Foundation platform, you need to understand the supported architectures and deployment models surrounding the components that deliver the capabilities of the platform. This section contains an overview of each component of a VCF private cloud with high-level comparisons of the benefits and implications of the options available within each component. For detailed design, including requirements and recommendations for each of the component models discussed in this section, refer to the [Design Library for VMware Cloud Foundation](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/design/design-library.html) section of this document.

With the release of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, new constructs, have been introduced into the architecture making it important to understand them, see the VCF Fleet, VCF Instances, and VCF Domains section of the [Product Overview](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/overview-of-vmware-cloud-foundation-9.html) for more details.
