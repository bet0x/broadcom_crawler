# Distributed Switch Detailed Design

A VCF Instance can support one or more supported Distributed Switch Models. This section describes the options, requirements and recommendations for each Distributed Switch Model.

- [Single Distributed Switch Model](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/design/design-library/network-designs/vsphere-cluster-network-models/simple-network-model.html)
- [Storage Separation Distributed Switch Model](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/design/design-library/network-designs/vsphere-cluster-network-models/storage-separation-network-model.html)
