## Planning and Preparation for the first VCF Instance in the VCF Fleet

| Procedure Grouping | Procedure | Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Planning and Preparation | Download the Planning and Preparation Workbook | The Planning and Preparation Workbook can be located on the Broadcom Technical Documentation site. |
| Pre-Requisites | Review and ensure compliance with the items listed in the Prerequisite Checklist tab of the Planning and Preparation Workbook | This will ensure that the all hardware, network and infrastructural pre-requisites are met before commencing deployment. |
| Sizing | In a distinct copy of the Planning and Preparation Workbook, populate the Management Domain Sizing tab | This will ensure that the management domain for the first VCF Instance is adequately sized to host components of the VCF Fleet that will reside in that instance. |
| Management Domain (First Instance) | In the same Planning and Preparation Workbook, select the following options on the VCF & VVF Planning tab   - VMware Cloud Foundation Deployment Version: 9.0.0.0 - Deployment Specification: VMware Cloud Foundation - Instance to perform operation on: First Instance - Operation to be performed: Deploy a new VCF fleet   Populate the following tabs:   - Populate the Management Domain Creation tab  Stretched Cluster section of the Management Domain Post Deploy tab | This will gather all the required physical network, IP Addressing and infrastructural details required to perform the deployment of the management domain in the first VCF Instance. |
| Workload Domain (First Instance) | In the same Planning and Preparation Workbook populate the following tabs:   - Populate the Workload Domain Creation tab  Stretched Cluster section of the Workload Domain Post Deploy tab | This will gather all the required physical network, IP Addressing and infrastructural details required to perform the deployment of the first workload domain in the first VCF Instance. |
