# VCF Edge Pattern 4: VCF Fleet with Multi Region, Distributed Edge

A large-scale VCF Edge deployment spanning multiple geographical regions, encompassing numerous distributed edge locations, all managed as a unified VCF fleet for consistent operations and life cycle management across a wide and diverse infrastructure.

| Design Attributes | Justification |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-Region Deployment | Addresses the need for global reach, localized services, data sovereignty requirements, and improved latency for users in different regions. |
| Centralized Management (Per Region) | Each major region (West US, East US, Europe) has its own independent VCF Instance (Instance 1, Instance 2, Instance 3) with its own Management Domain.  It offers localized control and management within each region, enhancing resilience against inter-region network disruptions and ensuring compliance with regional regulations. Meanwhile, centralized monitoring, licensing, and lifecycle management for each VCF instance are maintained from a central data center via VCF Operation.  VCF Fleet employs a dual-level management approach, combining centralized control with regional administration to optimize efficiency and scalability. This involves a division of responsibilities between Central IT and Regional IT teams:   - **Central IT Responsibilities:** Central IT provides overarching governance and standardization for the entire VCF Fleet. This includes:   **Lifecycle Management:** Centralized planning, coordination, and execution of upgrades and updates for all VCF instances across regions. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of compatibility issues.  **Certificate Management:** Centralized management of certificates for all VCF components (vCenter, ESXi, NSX). This simplifies certificate renewals, improves security posture, and ensures compliance with organizational security policies.  **Password Management:** Defining and enforcing password policies across the VCF Fleet, including password complexity, rotation, and storage. Central IT may also manage the storage of highly privileged passwords.  **Architecture and Standards:** Defining the overall VCF architecture, including workload domain design, network segmentation, and storage configurations. This ensures consistency and best practices are followed across all regions.  **Policy Enforcement:** Defining and enforcing global policies related to security, compliance, and resource management.   - **Regional IT Responsibilities:** Regional IT teams are responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of the VCF instances within their specific region. This includes:   **Day N Operations:** Performing routine tasks such as monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintaining the health of the local VCF instances.  **Resource Management:** Managing local compute, storage, and network resources, including provisioning, allocation, and optimization.  **User Management:** Managing local user accounts, permissions, and access control within the region, in accordance with central policies.  **Application Support:** Supporting the deployment and operation of applications running on the local VCF infrastructure.  **Local Compliance:** Ensuring adherence to any region-specific regulatory or compliance requirements, in addition to central policies. |
| Distributed Edge Sites | Extends compute and application capabilities closer to users and data sources in geographically dispersed locations. |
| VCF Operations Collector (Regional) | Enables localized monitoring and data collection within each region, potentially for performance optimization and troubleshooting, especially given the WAN latency. |

| Best Fit Scenarios |
| --- |
| - Organizations with geographically dispersed users or data sources: This is a fundamental requirement. If your users or data are spread across multiple cities, regions, or countries, VCF Fleet can help you bring applications and services closer to them. - Edge workloads with strict latency requirements: If your applications need to respond quickly, VCF Fleet's distributed edge architecture can help minimize latency by deploying workloads closer to the source of the data or the end-user. - Requirements for high availability and disaster recovery: VCF Fleet's multi-region capabilities enable you to deploy applications across multiple locations, ensuring that they remain available even if one location experiences an outage. - Need for centralized management and consistent operations at scale: If you have a large number of vSphere deployments to manage, VCF Fleet simplifies management by providing a single point of control and enabling you to enforce consistent configurations and policies across all locations. |
