# NSX

Use **NSX** as a network administrator for networking and automation for virtual machines, containers, or bare metal applications.

Starting with NSX 9.0, NSX is only available through VCF BOM and a standalone upgrade or fresh installation of NSX is not supported. You must use the VCF BOM and follow the recommended process to upgrade NSX 4.x to VCF 9.0. For more information about upgrading to VCF 9.0, see [Overview of Deploy, Converge, and Upgrade](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/overview-of-deploy--converge--and-upgrade.html).
