# Manual Upgrade to NSX 9 by Using Upgrade Coordinator

The automated upgrade method using SDDC Manager is recommended for most NSX upgrade scenarios. However, a manual upgrade method using NSX Manager is also available for scenarios that require a customized NSX upgrade.

Starting with VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0, the NSX VIBs are packaged as part of the ESX image by default. Therefore, the automated upgrade of these VIBs occurs as part of the ESX host upgrade process performed through SDDC Manager.

If you use NSX Manager instead to perform a manual upgrade of ESX 8.x hosts, only the NSX VIBs are upgraded. You must then use SDDC Manager separately to upgrade ESX on the hosts.

## Checklist for Manual NSX Upgrade

Use the following checklist to track your work through the manual upgrade process.

| Manual Upgrade Task | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Evaluate the operational impact of the upgrade. | See [Operational Impact of the Upgrade](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/operational-impact-of-nsx-t-upgrade.html). |
| Run the pre-checks to verify that system components are ready for the upgrade. | See [Run the NSX Upgrade Pre-check Bundle](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/run-the-upgrade-precheck-pub-bundle.html). |
| Complete the pre-upgrade tasks. | See [Pre-Upgrade Tasks for Upgrading NSX](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/pre-upgrade-tasks.html). |
| Verify that the NSX environment is in a healthy state. | See [Verify the Current State of NSX](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/verify-the-nsxt-environment.html#GUID-1918fca9-42df-4b04-a829-731bacb4b6d8). |
| Make the required changes in your system configuration if your deployment contains features that are not supported in the target release. | See [Manage Unsupported Features](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/manage-deprecated-nsx-features.html). |
| Download the latest NSX upgrade bundle (.mub file). | See [Download the NSX Upgrade Bundle](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/download-the-nsxt-upgrade-bundle.html#GUID-12b88c56-3236-4d7c-af90-a03c4f75e077). |
| In NSX Manager, upgrade the upgrade coordinator. | See [Update the Upgrade Coordinator in NSX Manager](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/upgrade-the-upgrade-coordinator.html). |
| In NSX Manager, upgrade the Management Plane. | See [Upgrade the Management Plane Through NSX Manager](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/upgrade-management-plane-from-nsx-3-2-1-x-and-later.html). |
| In NSX Manager, create upgrade unit groups of edge nodes, define the order of upgrade for each unit group, and complete the edge node upgrades. | See [Upgrade the NSX Edge Cluster Through NSX Manager](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/upgrade-nsx-edge-cluster-nsxt.html#GUID-6a5521c4-5b29-46cf-800b-9266d4dedf5c). |
| If you want to manually upgrade the NSX VIBs on host transport nodes, create upgrade unit groups of hosts in NSX Manager. Define the order of upgrade for each unit group and complete the upgrade of NSX VIBs on the host transport nodes. | See [Configure Hosts for a Manual Upgrade](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/upgrading-nsx--to-version-9/manual-upgrade-to-nsx-9-by-using-upgrade-coordinator/configure-hosts-nsx-t.html). |
