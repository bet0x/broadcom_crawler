2. Click the version of NSX to which you are upgrading.
3. Locate the NSX version Upgrade Bundle and verify that the upgrade bundle filename extension ends with .mub.

   The upgrade bundle filename has the following format VMware-NSX-upgrade-bundle-versionnumber.buildnumber.mub.
4. Click the download icon to download the upgrade bundle to the system where you access the NSX Global Manager UI.
