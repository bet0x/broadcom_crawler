# Download Install Binaries from an Online or Offline Depot

After you connect the VCF Installer appliance to an online or offline depot, download the required binaries to the VCF Installer appliance.

Configure a connection to an online or offline depot.

1. In a web browser, log in to the VMware Cloud Foundation Installer appliance administration interface: https://installer\_appliance\_FQDN. 

   Enter the admin@local user and password you provided when you deployed the appliance and then click Log In.
2. Click Depot Settings.
3. In the Binary Management section, select a product and version from the drop-down menus. 

   The UI displays all the required binaries for your product and version, including information about the file size and download status.
4. Select the binaries to download and click Download. 

   The VCF Installer downloads and validates the binaries. Progress is displayed in the Download Status column.

After the binaries are successfully downloaded, you are ready to deploy.
