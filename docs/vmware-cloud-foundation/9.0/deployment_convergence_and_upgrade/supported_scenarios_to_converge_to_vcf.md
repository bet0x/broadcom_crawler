# Supported Scenarios to Converge to VCF

You can converge the following non-VCF deployments to a VCF 9.0.x platform.

During the converge process, you use VCF Installer to specify deployment information for your environment such as your existing vSphere infrastructure, VMware Aria infrastructure, and other information in the deployment wizard. Any missing VMware Cloud Foundation software components are automatically deployed and configured using the information provided. Existing vSphere infrastructure is used to create the management domain of the VCF Instance.

You can download and complete the Planning and Preparation Workbook to help plan and gather all the information required for deployment.
