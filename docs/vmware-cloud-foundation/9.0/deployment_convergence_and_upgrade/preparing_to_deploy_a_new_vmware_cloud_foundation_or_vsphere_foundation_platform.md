# Preparing to Deploy a New VMware Cloud Foundation or vSphere Foundation Platform

Before can you use the VCF Installer to deploy a new VMware Cloud Foundation or VMware vSphere Foundation platform, you must prepare your environment.

Before you start deploying a new platform, you must deploy and configure the necessary infrastructure. You can use the Planning and Preparation Workbook to gather all of the information you need to deploy VCF or vSphere Foundation. You can also refer to the [VMware Cloud Foundation Design](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/bin/gethidpage?ux-context-string=design_guide_main&appid=vcf-9-0&language=&format=rendered) for specific requirements and recommendations for the design of each component. Before you deploy a new platform, you must:

- Review the Prerequisite Checklist in the Planning and Preparation Workbook. See [Planning and Preparation](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/planning-and-preparation.html).
- Image your ESX hosts. See [Preparing ESX Hosts for VMware Cloud Foundation or vSphere Foundation](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/deploying-a-new-vmware-cloud-foundation-or-vmware-vsphere-foundation-private-cloud-/preparing-your-environment/preparing-esx-hosts-for-vmware-cloud-foundation-or-vmware-vsphere-foundation.html).
- Download the VCF Installer appliance from the Broadcom Support portal.
