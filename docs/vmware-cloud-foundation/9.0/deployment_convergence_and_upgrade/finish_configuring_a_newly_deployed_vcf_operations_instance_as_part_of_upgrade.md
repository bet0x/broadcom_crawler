# Finish Configuring a Newly Deployed VCF Operations Instance as Part of Upgrade

If you have deployed a new instance of VCF Operations as part of the upgrade process, you must finish the configuration and deployment of the remaining components. If you have upgraded your VCF Operations instance to VCF Operations 9.0, these configurations are already present and you can skip that section and proceed to [Apply VMware Cloud Foundation Configuration Updates](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/upgrade-the-management-domain-to-vmware-cloud-foundation-5-2/apply-configuration-updates.html).
