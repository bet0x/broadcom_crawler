# Download the NSX Upgrade Bundle

The upgrade bundle (.mub) contains all the files to upgrade the NSX infrastructure. Before you begin the upgrade process, you must download the correct upgrade bundle version.

You can also navigate to the upgrade bundle and save the URL. When you upgrade the upgrade coordinator, paste the URL so that the upgrade bundle is uploaded from the Broadcom Support portal.

1. Locate the NSX build on the [Broadcom Support portal](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/downloads).
2. Navigate to the upgrade bundle file and click Read More.
3. Verify that the upgrade bundle filename extension ends with .mub. 

   The upgrade bundle filename has a format similar to VMware-NSX-upgrade-bundle-ReleaseNumberNSXBuildNumber.mub.
4. Download the NSX upgrade bundle to the same system you are using to access the NSX Manager user interface.
