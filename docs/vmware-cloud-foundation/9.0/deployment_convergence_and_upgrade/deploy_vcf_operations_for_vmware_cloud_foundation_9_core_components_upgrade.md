# Deploy VCF Operations for VMware Cloud Foundation 9 Core Components Upgrade

If you are planning to upgrade a VMware Cloud Foundation 5.x instance that has no VMware Aria Suite components installed, you must prepare for the upgrade by deploying the VCF Operations nodes and the VCF Operations fleet management appliance. You do not deploy the VCF Operations Collector (cloud proxy) before your SDDC Manager is upgraded to version 9.

If your VCF instance has some VMware Aria Suite components installed, first upgrade those components. See [Upgrading Management Components with VMware Aria Suite Lifecycle](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/deployment/upgrading-cloud-foundation/preparing-your-vcf-9-management-components/upgrading-management-components.html).

You can deploy VCF Automation after upgrading the management domain.
