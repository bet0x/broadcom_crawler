# Getting Started Details

When you create a policy, you must give the policy a meaningful name and description so that users know the purpose of the policy.

## Where You Assign the Policy Name and Description

To add a name and description to a policy, from the left menu, click Infrastructure OperationsConfigurations, and then click the Policy Definition tile. Click Add to add a policy or select the required policy, and then in the right pane, click Edit Policy to edit a policy. The name and description appear in the Create or Edit policy workspace.

Name and Description Options in the Create or Edit Policy Workspace



| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Name of the policy as it appears in the Create or Edit Policy screens, and in areas where the policy applies to objects, such as Custom Groups. |
| Description | Meaningful description of the policy. For example, use the description to indicate which policy is inherited, and any specific information that users must understand the relationship of the policy to one or more groups of objects. |
| Inherit From | The base policy that is used as a starting point. All settings from the base policy will be inherited as default settings in your new policy. You can override these settings to customize the new policy.  Select a base policy to inherit the policy settings as a starting point for your new policy. |
