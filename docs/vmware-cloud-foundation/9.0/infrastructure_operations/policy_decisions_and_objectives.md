# Policy Decisions and Objectives

Implementing policy decisions in
VCF Operations is typically the
responsibility of the Infrastructure Administrator or the Virtual Infrastructure
Administrator, but users who have privileges can also create and modify policies.

You must be aware of the
policies established to analyze and monitor the resources in your IT
infrastructure.

- If you are a Network Operations engineer, you must
  understand how policies affect the data that VCF Operations reports on
  objects, and which policies assigned to objects report alerts and issues.
- If you are the person whose role is to recommend an
  initial setup for policies, you typically edit and configure the policies in
  VCF Operations.
- If your primary role is to assess problems that occur
  in your environment, but you do not have the responsibility to change the policies,
  you must still understand how the policies applied to objects affect the data that
  appears in VCF Operations. For
  example, you might need to know which policies apply to objects that are associated
  with particular alerts.
- If you are a typical application user who receives
  reports from VCF Operations, you must
  have a high-level understanding of the operational policies so that you can
  understand the reported data values.
