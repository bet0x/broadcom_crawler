# VCF Automation for VM Apps Organization Account in VCF Operations

VCF Automation for VM Apps Organization management pack enhances the VCF Operations platform by providing cloud-aware visibility into infrastructure operations. This integration allows administrators to monitor the health, performance, and capacity risks of connected cloud environments.

It also supports efficient workload placement for VMs within managed clusters and offers tools to diagnose and resolve issues with vSphere endpoints directly from the operations dashboard.

- Gain visibility into the performance and health of cloud zones integrated with VCF Operations.
- Import and synchronize existing cloud accounts from VCF Automation to VCF Operations.
- Manage the workload placement of VMs that are part of the clusters managed by VCF Automation.
- Integrate and troubleshoot vSphere endpoint issues associated with VCF Automation using the VCF Operations dashboard.

  In this release only vSphere endpoints are supported.
