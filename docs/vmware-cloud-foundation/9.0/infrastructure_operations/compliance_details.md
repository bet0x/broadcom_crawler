# Compliance Details

Compliance is a measurement that ensures that the objects in your environment meet industrial, governmental, regulatory, or internal standards. You can unlock and configure the settings for the compliance for the object types in your policy.

## Where You Override the Policy Compliance

To view and override the policy compliance setting, from the left menu click Infrastructure OperationsConfigurations, and then click the Policy Definition tile. Click Add to add a policy or select the required policy. In the right pane, click Edit Policy to edit a policy. In the Create or Edit policy workspace, click Compliance

View the compliance thresholds and configure the settings for your policy.

If you do not configure the policy element, your policy inherits the settings from the selected base policy.
