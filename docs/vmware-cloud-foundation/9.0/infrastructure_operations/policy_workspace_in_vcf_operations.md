# Policy Workspace in VCF Operations

The policy workspace allows you to quickly create and modify policies. To create a policy, you can inherit the settings from an existing policy, and you can modify the settings in existing policies if you have adequate permissions. After you create a policy, or edit an existing policy, you can apply the policy to one or more objects or object groups.

## How the Policy Workspace Works

Every policy includes a set of packages, and uses the defined problems, symptoms, metrics, and properties in those packages to apply to specific objects or object groups in your environment. You can view the details for the settings inherited from the base policy, and display specific settings for certain object types. You can override the settings of other policies, and include additional policy settings to apply to the object types.

Use the Add and Edit options to create policies and edit existing policies.

## Where You Create and Modify a Policy

To create and modify policies, from the left menu, click Infrastructure OperationsConfigurations, and then click the Policy Definition tile. Click Add to add a policy or select the required policy, and then in the right pane, click Edit Policy to edit the policy. The policy workspace is where you select the base policies, and customize and override the settings for analysis, metrics, properties, alert definitions, and symptom definitions. In this workspace, you can apply the policy to objects or object groups.

To remove a policy from the list, select the policy, click the horizontal ellipse, and select Delete.

## Policy Workspace Options

The policy workspace includes a step-by-step workflow to create and edit a policy, and apply the policy to custom object groups.
