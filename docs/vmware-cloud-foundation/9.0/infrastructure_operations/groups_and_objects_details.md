# Groups and Objects details

You can assign your local policy to one or more objects or groups of objects to have VCF Operations analyze those objects according to the settings in your policy. You can trigger alerts when the defined threshold levels are violated, and display the results in your dashboards, views, and reports.

## How the Groups and Objects Workspace Works

When you create a policy, or modify the settings in an existing policy, you apply the policy to one or more objects or groups of objects. VCF Operations uses the settings in the policy to analyze and collect data from the associated objects, and displays the data in dashboards, views, and reports.

## Where You Apply a Policy to Groups and Objects

To apply the policy to an object or groups of objects, from the left menu click Infrastructure OperationsConfigurations, and then click the Policy Definition tile. Click Add to add a policy or select the required policy. In the right pane, click Edit Policy to edit a policy. In the Create or Edit policies workspace, click Groups and Objects.

## Groups and Objects Options

To apply the policy to an object or groups of objects, select the check box for the groups or objects in the workspace.

You can then view the groups and objects associated with the policy. From the left menu click Infrastructure OperationsConfigurations, and then click the Policy Definition tile. Click Add to add a policy or select the required policy. In the right pane, click Edit Policy to edit a policy. In the Create or Edit policies workspace, click Groups and Objects. Click the Custom Groups tab to apply the policy to one or more groups of objects. Click the Objects tabs to apply the policy to one or more objects.
