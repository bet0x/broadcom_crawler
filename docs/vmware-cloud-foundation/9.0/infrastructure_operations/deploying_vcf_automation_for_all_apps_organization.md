# Deploying VCF Automation for All Apps Organization

If you have a VMware Cloud Foundation license, VCF Automation for All Apps Organization is installed when you deploy VCF Operations using Fleet Manager.

The VCF Automation must be created from Fleet ManagementIdentity & Access. The VCF Automation for All Apps Organization adapter is automatically created after VCF Automation is installed. Direct creation of the adapter instance is not supported. Any directly created adapter instances will be automatically stopped after some time.
