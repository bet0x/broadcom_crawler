# Permissions Required to Monitor vCenter Services

A user must have certain privileges to discover the services of vCenter.

If you are using a standalone vCenter, the user should be a member of the 'SystemConfiguration.Administrator' group or have the administrator permissions. For more information, see see [Privileges Required for Configuring a vCenter Account](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/infrastructure-operations/connect-to-data-sources/vsphere/configuring-a-vcenter-server-cloud-account-in-vrealize-operations/privileges-required-for-configuring-a-vcenter-adapter-instance.html#GUID-fd32d12e-f9d4-443d-9fe7-d7afcbf99e69-en).
