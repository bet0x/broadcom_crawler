## Policies That VCF Operations Includes

All policies exist under the Base Settings, because the data adapters and solutions installed in your VCF Operations instance provide a collective group of base settings that apply to all objects. In the policies library, these settings are called Base Settings.

The Base Settings policy is the umbrella policy for all other policies, and appears at the top of the policy list in the policies library. All the other policies reside under the Base Settings, because the data adapters and solutions installed in your VCF Operations instance provide a collective group of base settings that apply to all objects.

The configuration based policy set includes policies provided with VCF Operations that you use for specific settings on objects to report on your objects. This set includes several types of policies:

- Efficiency alerts policies for infrastructure objects and virtual machines
- Health alerts policies for infrastructure objects
- Overcommit policies for CPU and Memory
- Risk alerts policies for infrastructure objects and virtual machines

The Default Policy includes a set of rules that applies to most of your objects.
