# Lifecycle Management

Use **VCF Operations** as a VI administrator to manage the lifecycle of the management and SDDC components in VCF, including downloading binaries and updating VCF fleet and VCF Instances.

For VCF, you use VCF Operations for these capabilities. For vSphere Foundation, you perform the supported operations on the individual management components.
