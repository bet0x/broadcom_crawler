# Expand a VCF Domain

You can expand the management domain or a workload domain to add resources to support additional workloads or availability.

To expand a VCF domain, you can:

- Add an ESX host from the global inventory to an SDDC cluster.

  By adding an individual host to an existing VCF domain, you can expand the amount of resources contained within an existing SDDC cluster up to the supported vSphere maximums.
- Add a new SDDC cluster to a VCF domain.

  VCF domains support multiple SDDC clusters. You can add an additional SDDC cluster to an existing VCF domain to provide for increased capacity.
