# Rename a Network Pool

You can rename an existing network pool.

To perform this task in the vSphere Client, you must have access to the management domain vCenter, or your VCF Instance must be configured with VCF SSO and vCenter linking. See [Configuring VCF Single Sign-On](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/fleet-management/what-is.html) and [Linking vCenter instances in VCF Operations](/us/en/vmware-cis/vcf/vcf-9-0-and-later/9-0/fleet-management/linking-vcenter-systems-in-vmware-cloud-foundation-operations.html). As an alternative, you can perform this task using the SDDC Manager UI (https://<sddc-manager-fqdn>).

1. In the vSphere Client, click Global Inventory ListsHostsNetwork Pools.
2. Click the vertical ellipsis (three dots) in the network pool row you want to edit and then click Rename Network Pool.
3. Enter a new name for the network pool.
4. Click Rename.
