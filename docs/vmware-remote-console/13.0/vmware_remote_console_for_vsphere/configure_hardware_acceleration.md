# Configure Hardware Acceleration

Hardware acceleration can improve performance and reduce battery usage. This functionality is turned off by default to avoid breaking VMRC when used with unstable graphic cards. You can enable it in the VMRC settings.

1. In a web browser, go to vmrc://settings and click Open Link. A dialog window appears. If VMRC was already opened:

   1. On Windows, select VMRC > Preferences.
   2. On Linux, select File > Remote Console Preferences.
2. On Windows or Linux, select Hardware Acceleration.
3. Click OK.
