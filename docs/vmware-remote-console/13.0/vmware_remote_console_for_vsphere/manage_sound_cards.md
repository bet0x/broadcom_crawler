# Manage Sound Cards

On Windows and Linux, you can use VMRC to add or remove sounds cards on a virtual machine. This feature is not available in MacOS.

2. Open the virtual machine settings.

   1. On Windows, select VMRC > Manage > Virtual Machine Settings.
   2. On Linux, select Virtual Machine > Virtual Machine Settings.
3. Open the Hardware tab and click Add.
4. Select Sound Card and click Finish.

If you no longer need a sound card configured, you can select the sound card and click Remove.
