# Configuring and Managing Devices

You can use VMRC to add devices to virtual machines, including hard disks, CD/DVD drives, and parallel or serial ports. You can also change virtual memory and processor settings, modify settings for existing devices, and manage ports and I/O devices.

Not all features are available on all VMRC client operating systems.
