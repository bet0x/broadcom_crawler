# Installing VMware Remote Console

You can install VMware Remote Console on Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

For a list of client operating systems supported for install, see the release notes for your version of VMRC.

You install VMware Remote Console from a Zip file on Windows, a bundle file on Linux, or from the Apple store on MacOS. Sections below describe where to find the bundle and Zip file on the Broadcom support site.

The virtual machine management and device configuration options described later in this guide might not available for vSphere installations running VMware Cloud Director or (Aria) VCF Automation. In such cases, you should ignore chapters about configuring and managing virtual machines and devices.
