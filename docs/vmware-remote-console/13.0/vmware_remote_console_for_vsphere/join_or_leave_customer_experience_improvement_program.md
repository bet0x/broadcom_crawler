# Join or Leave Customer Experience Improvement Program

This product participates in VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).

The CEIP provides VMware with technical information used to improve the quality, reliability, and functionality of VMware products and services. The information does not personally identify any individual. Details regarding the data collected through CEIP and the purposes for which it is used by VMware are set forth in the [Trust and Assurance Framework](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/security/trustvmware).

When you start VMRC for the first time, you are prompted to select whether you want to participate in the CEIP. You can also choose to join or leave the CEIP at any time thereafter by performing the following procedure.

1. In a web browser, go to vmrc://settings and click Open Link. A dialog window appears. If VMRC was already opened:

   1. On Windows, select VMRC > Preferences.
   2. On MacOS, select VMware Remote Console > Settings.
   3. On Linux, select File > Remote Console Preferences.
2. Click Feedback.
3. Select or deselect Join the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program.
